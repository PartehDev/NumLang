Well done.<br>Now, here's the syntax.<br>1 = Exit and print the output<br>2 = Add 1 to value<br>3 = Subtract 1 from value<br>4 = Loop x times and add 1 to value each time (x being the next number, cancels out all effects, like the 1 exit)<br>5 = Print "Hello, world!"<br>6 = Value Squared<br>To make a simple hello world, it's just the string "51". The end! See the next part which im making soon<br>also it really likes to throw an error if the value is greater than 62</p></body></html>
